BLOCK ITERATIVE REWEIGHTED ALGORITHMS FOR SUPER-RESOLUTION OF SPECTRALLY SPARSE SIGNALS


A. INTRODUCTION
We propose novel algorithms that enhance the performance of recovering unknown continuous-valued frequencies
from undersampled signals. Our iterative reweighted frequency recovery algorithms employ the support knowledge gained from
earlier steps of our algorithms as block prior information to enhance frequency recovery. Our methods improve the performance
of the atomic norm minimization which is a useful heuristic in recovering continuous-valued frequency contents. Numerical
results demonstrate that our block iterative reweighted methods provide both better recovery performance and faster speed than other known methods.



B. GOALS
Finding frequnecy information with a few randomly chosen time sampled data
