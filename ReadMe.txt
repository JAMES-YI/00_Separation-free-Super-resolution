ToDos
- clean codes and data
- experimental results demonstration of HMC and ANM
  with noiseless observations: (1) under different frequency separations; 
  (2) different sampling patterns; (3) different number of atoms; 
  (4) different sampling complexity; (5) different types of atoms
- experimental results demonstration of HMC and ANM 
  with noisy observations: (0) under different noise levels; 
  (1) under different frequency separations; 
  (2) different sampling patterns; (3) different number of atoms; 
  (4) different sampling complexity; (5) different types of atoms
- experimental results demonstration of HMC and ANM in phase transition figures:
  (0) under different noise levels; 
  (1) under different frequency separations; 
  (2) different sampling patterns; (3) different number of atoms; 
  (4) different sampling complexity; (5) different types of atoms
- experimental results demonstration for atom separation lower bound 
  in [Xu et al., 2017] and [Tang et al., 2015]
- experimental results demonstration for successful recovery rate wrt separation
- experimental results demonstration for theorems
